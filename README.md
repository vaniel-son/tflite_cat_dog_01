# tflite_cat_dog_01

TFLife Cat Dog Analyzer

## Getting Started

This project uses TensorFlow Lite to categorize dogs and cat images. 

It uses the Flutter package TFLITE, but the existing package is no longer managed, and does not work with Flutter 3.0+. This project has a modified veversion of the TFLITE package. It's been upgraded to work with Android Embedded v2, which makes it compatible with Flutter 3.0+. The package is located in 'custom_packages'.
